  "C1": "Can express ideas fluently, flexibly, and effectively for social, academic, and professional purposes.",
  "C2": "Can understand virtually everything heard or read, and express themselves precisely."
}

**Input: Evaluation Data**
The following object contains a list of evaluated questions and their answers. Some questions are open-ended (type: "text") and must be analyzed for grammar, fluency, vocabulary, and pronunciation as appropriate:
[
  {
    "question_text": "Read this passage and explain it in your own words.",
    "type": "text",

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze all available answers (including type: "text") based on their content and the question context.
2. Do not assess answers that are out of question context.
3. Infer the user's cumulative CEFR level (from A1 to C2) based on the quality of their responses.
4. Consider all core components: pronunciation, grammar, fluency, and vocabulary.
5. Be strict but fair. Do not guess a level if the data is insufficient.

IMPORTANT RULES (must be followed exactly):
1) Pre-conditions: If fewer than 3 answered items are present, OR if there are no text answers and no spoken answers, you MUST return the "Not enough information" JSON (see format below). Do not attempt to guess.
2) Evidence: Your decision MUST be based only on the provided inputs. Do not invent user replies, do not assume unseen speaking samples.
